# Pokemon for beginners

## Data Source
This data was obtained from kaggle.com, but the data set is no longer available there. I've include the CSVs I used to create my dashboard in this repository.

## Tools Used
- `Excel` - for exploration and aggregation of the data

- `Power BI` - for creating interactive dashboard

### Power BI Story
The primary use case for this dashboard is to understand the different types of Pokemeon, their potential evolutionary track, and a series of useful stats on a type or per Pokemon basis.
